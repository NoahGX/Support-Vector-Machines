# Support Vector Machines

## Overview
The purpose of this Jupyter Notebook is to provide a comprehensive guide to implementing Support Vector Machines (SVM) for machine learning tasks. It covers the theoretical foundations of SVMs as well as practical implementation using Python libraries.

## Features
- **Dependency Installation**: Guide on how to install necessary Python libraries.
- **Matrix Computations**: Detailed steps to compute the matrix $Q$ required for SVM.
- **Variable Computation**: Scripts to compute essential variables used in SVM.
- **Quadratic Programming**: Integration with `quadprog` for solving optimization problems.
- **Decision Boundary Solving**: Final task to determine and plot the decision boundary of the SVM.

## Usage
- Ensure all prerequisites are installed.
- Run each cell sequentially to understand the SVM implementation steps.
- Modify parameters or datasets as required to experiment with different configurations.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `quadprog`

## Input
The notebook is pre-configured to use synthetic data generated within the notebook. Users can replace this with real datasets by modifying the data loading sections.

## Output
- Outputs include computed matrices and variables relevant to the SVM model.
- Visualizations of the SVM decision boundary.

## Notes
- Make sure all prerequisites are installed as instructed in the notebook.
- This notebook is basic in order to demonstrate the workings of SVM and requires modifications for production use.
